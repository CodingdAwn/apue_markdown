## mkdir, mkdirat, and rmdir Functions

Directories are created with the mkdir and mkdirat functions, and deleted with the rmdir function.

```
#include <sys/stat.h>
int mkdir(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);
int mkdirat(int fd, const char *pathname, mode_t mode);
```
These funtions creat a new, empty directory. The entries for dot and dot-dot are created automatically.
The specified file aceess permissions, mode, are modified by the file mode creation mask of the process.
