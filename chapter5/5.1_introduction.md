##Introduction
In this chapter, we describe the standard I/O library. This library is specified by the ISO  
C standard because it has been implemented on many operating systems other than the  
UNIX System. Additional interfaces are defined as extensions to the ISO C standard by  
the Single UNIX Specification.  
  The standard I/O library handles such details as buffer allocation and performing  
I/O in optimal-sized chunks, obviating our need to worry about using the correct block  
size (as in Section 3.9). Thsi makes the library easy to use, but at the same time  
introduces another set of problems if we're not cognizant of what's going on.
